But my favorite part of being a parent is the concept of having a relationship with somebody. With two people now that I hope to have for the rest of my life. And the idea of designing the software of these two individuals by exposing them to certain things and protecting them from other things. Feels like a wild responsibility, but one the I feel extremely lucky to have.",

      "content": "So we just had Christmas time and to see a three and a half year old be completely taken by the magic of Christmas, but the concept of Santa by these things that we all take for granted and we probably laugh at and think of silly in or like crusty older age. It's a genuine test of kind of the size of your heart. And it I feel like mine's expanded in the last couple of weeks just from experience and Christmas with my two sons. So that is a concept that I'm a relatively new parent. You know, there's some people, my parents have been parents for almost 40 years. No longer because I have older sisters, but even as a relatively new parent, there's something about being the parent of two boys who I love more than anything else in the world that is incredibly. I'm feeling is like making the cop even bigger, which is why all this cool. That's my favorite part about being a parent.",
