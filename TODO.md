- [ ] Controllers should be replaced with low level database functions that react to webscokets
- [ ] Probably need to re-write client logic as caching layers doesn't make much sense in real time
- [ ] Replace routers with socket subscriptions, can you abstract the logic easily (same pattern?)
- [ ] Clone front end masters course repo before you get on the plane!
- [ ] Auth is obviously the same pattern server side, how do you stop websocket running if user isn't signed in
- [ ] Can you just replace the fetch abstractions and get rid of the cache?
- [ ] Can you put constants in root and use them in both server and client (item:get)
